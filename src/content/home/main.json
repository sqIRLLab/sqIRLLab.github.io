  "description": "The Interpretable Representation Learning lab, sqIRL, at the University of Antwerp pursues fundamental research at the intersection of machine learning and interpretability/explainability. Our research focuses on the inner-workings of AI systems and the learning processes that produce them. We aim to develop AI systems that are interpretable/explainable and more efficient in their use of data and computational resources.",
